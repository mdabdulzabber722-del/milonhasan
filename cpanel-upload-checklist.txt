BEFORE UPLOADING:
â–¡ Project has been built (npm run build completed)
â–¡ dist folder contains all necessary files
â–¡ .htaccess file is present in dist folder
â–¡ You have cPanel access and domain ready

UPLOAD PROCESS:
â–¡ Login to cPanel
â–¡ Open File Manager
â–¡ Navigate to public_html folder
â–¡ Clear existing files (if fresh install)
â–¡ Upload ALL contents from dist folder
â–¡ Do NOT upload the dist folder itself, only its contents

FILES TO VERIFY AFTER UPLOAD:
â–¡ index.html (main file)
â–¡ .htaccess (for routing - CRITICAL!)
â–¡ aviator.png (favicon)
