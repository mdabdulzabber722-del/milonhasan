# 🚨 Railway Deployment Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 **Your Current Issue**

Based on your screenshot, you're seeing:
- ❌ "There was an error deploying from source"
- ❌ "Deploy failed (2 minutes ago)"
- ⚠️ "There is no active deployment for this service"

## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Step 1: Check Build Logs**
1. **Click on the failed deployment** in Railway dashboard
2. **Look for the "Logs" tab** or "Build Logs"
3. **Scroll to the bottom** to see the exact error message
4. **Common errors you might see:**
   - `npm install` failed
   - `npm run build` failed
   - Port binding issues
   - Missing dependencies

### **Step 2: Fix Common Issues**

#### **Issue A: Missing Dependencies**
```bash
# In your project folder, run:
npm install
npm run build

# If this fails locally, fix the errors first
```

#### **Issue B: Wrong Node.js Version**
Add this to your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "18.x"
  }
}
```

#### **Issue C: Build Script Issues**
Verify your `package.json` has these scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "start": "vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-3000}",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Force Redeploy**

#### **Method 1: Trigger New Deployment**
1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Make a small change** (add a space to README.md)
3. **Commit and push** the change
4. **Railway will automatically redeploy**

#### **Method 2: Manual Redeploy**
1. **In Railway dashboard**, click "Deploy"
2. **Select "Redeploy"** or "Deploy Latest"
3. **Wait for the new deployment**

### **Step 4: Check Your Files**

Make sure these files exist in your repository:
- [ ] `package.json` (with correct scripts)
- [ ] `vite.config.ts` (Vite configuration)
- [ ] `src/` folder (your source code)
- [ ] `public/` folder (static assets)
- [ ] `index.html` (main HTML file)

### **Step 5: Environment Variables**

If your app needs environment variables:
1. **Go to Railway dashboard** → Variables tab
2. **Add required variables**:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - Any other custom variables

## 🔧 **Quick Fix Commands**

Run these in your project folder:

```bash
# 1. Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# 2. Test build locally
npm run build

# 3. Test preview locally
npm run preview

# 4. If all works, push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment issues"
git push
```
